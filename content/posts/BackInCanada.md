I'm back in Canada after 4 months of travel in Central America! I had an incredible experience backpacking around the region. During my trip I managed to visit Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, and southern Mexico. I learned some Spanish, climbed a volcano to watch another erupt, surfed on the Pacific, SCUBA dove in the Caribbean, and explored cenotes in Mexico. For stories of this trip and others check out my [travel blog](https://trainplanehostelhotel.wordpress.com/).

Now that I'm back home I'm looking for a job! I'm looking for a permanent or contract role doing full-stack or back-end web development but I'm more than happy to discuss other types of roles. Feel free to email me if you think I would fit well on your team!
