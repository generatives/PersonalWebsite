Hi there! I'm a software developer specializing in full stack web development but I'm interested in just about every discipline. I live in beautiful Vancouver, B.C. and am currently looking for full-time work in the area.

## Elevator Pitch Resume

I have been working in the industry for 3 years with professional experience in full-stack web, mobile, and desktop app development. Most recently I worked in a leadership role where I was involved in product roadmapping, project planning, coding, QA, and customer support. I pride myself on developing and operating high-quality products.
