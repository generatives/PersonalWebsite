## Education

I graduated from the Electrical Engineering program at the University of British Columbia Okanagan. While in school I entered the co-op program. As a co-op student I would take 4-8 month breaks from school to work. During my co-op terms I worked in various Software Development roles where I was exposed to full-stack web and desktop app development. By the time I graduated I had acquired 16 months of professional experience and a love of software development.

## Interests

Now that I'm out of school I continue my education by reading books, listening to podcasts, and working on hobby projects.

When I'm not developing my software skill set I try to keep myself in shape by swimming laps at the pool and working out in the gym. I really enjoy getting into the outdoors by hiking, camping, and rock climbing.

## Hobby Projects

I always like to have one or two hobby projects on the go. Many of my projects revolve around game development. Recent examples are a [simple cross platform game engine](/projects/tortuga) and a high-level game state synchronization library. My projects are often outside of what I would consider realistic for my skill set and available time and as a result never really get finished. To me the purpose is more to do with gaining technical knowledge and practicing the process of development then actually producing a product.
